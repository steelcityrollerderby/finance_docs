## Taxes

Get them done on time (BEFORE MONDAY, APRIL 15).

Our current tax guy is in the treasury email as Kenny Bonus. His email is `kenny@bonusaccounting.com`. He's super helpful. You will need to get him information from Xero and answer some other questions.

## BCO-10

I think that this is due mid-May each year. In 2019, Kenny was able to help us out. We have to print it out and send it in ourselves. Ask up front next year when you hit up Kenny about taxes.
