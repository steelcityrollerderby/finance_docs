## Taxes

Get them done on time (BEFORE MONDAY, APRIL 15).

Our current tax guy is in the treasury email as Kenny Bonus. His email is `kenny@bonusaccounting.com`. He's super helpful. You will need to get him information from Xero and answer some other questions.

## BCO-10

I think that this is due mid-May each year. In 2019, I'm having Kenny help us fill that out and file it for us.
