# BOUT DAY TREASURER DUTIES

Important note: both PISA and PISA Pub will take debit cards as well as checks.

## Before the bout

1. Make sure that both merch and door count their boxes up
2. Pay for the venue ($750)
3. Settle up with PISA Pub for any packages owed from last game (they'll send you an invoice beforehand)

## At 2nd bout halftime

1. Gather counted-down box sheet from door (necessary for the bout breakdown)
2. Make sure that the door knows how much money to leave in the box for the next bout ($200-$300, as many small bills as possible/makes sense).

## Immediately after the bout

1. Gather counted-down box sheet from merch (necessary for the bout breakdown)
2. Pay the photographer ($100 + tip - so like $125 total) - PAY WITH CHECK
3. Pay for the bout food (as of this writing, $200 + tip - so like $250 total)

## Generally after the bout

1. Create the bout breakdown (found on the 2019 budget spreadsheet under `Bout Breakdown`)
2. Post the bout breakdown on `#leagueannouncements`
3. Watch for the EMT invoice and pay that
4. Watch for the printing invoice and pay that

## How to make the bout breakdown:

Navigate to the 2019 budget spreadsheet to the `Bout Breakdown` page. You'll see something like this:

#### Where each number comes from:

1. Door cash tickets: from the counted down door box (subtract the cash that was originally in there from the cash that was in there when you finish door at the halftime of the 2nd bout and you get this number)
2. Door credit tickets: go to [square](https://squareup.com/login) and look for the day of the bout. Get the number from the row marked `Box Office`
3. Skater sold tickets: see the deposit after the bout or talk to the ticket master
4. Online tickets: talk to the person that has the login for brown paper tickets
5. Total tickets: add 1-4
6. Merch cash: from the counted down merch box (subtract the cash that  was originally in there from the cash that was in there when you finish merch to get this number)
7. Merch credit: go to [square](https://squareup.com/login) and look for the day of the bout. Get this number from the row marked `Merch Booth`.
8. Total Merch: add 6-7
9. Venue rental: always $750 in 2019
10. Photography: $100 base + $25 tip, so $125 total in 2019
11. After party: as of 05/2019, $200 base for food. Tip $50 to get $250. (this differs from the screenshot above)
12. EMTs: pretty reliably between $292 and $319; you'll get an invoice though
13. Printing: pretty reliably $141; you'll get an invoice though
14. Hospitality: ask whoever is in charge of bout hospitality, it's been between $20 and $50 per bout
15. Other expenses: talk to the head of bout production to see if there are any other expenses associated with the bout (for example, tape for the track which is really fucking expensive for some reason)
16. Total: add 9-15 
17. Profit: number from 5 + number from 8 - number from 16

(also for Overall Total, add Total Merch and Total tickets)

Post this in `#leagueannouncements` ASAP and let people generally know how we did in comparison to previous bouts. Encourage them to check out the 2019 budget spreadsheet.
