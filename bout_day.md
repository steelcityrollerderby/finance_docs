## At 2nd bout halftime

1. Gather counted-down box sheet from door (necessary for the bout breakdown)
2. Make sure that the door knows how much money to leave in the box for the next bout ($200-$300, as many small bills as possible/makes sense).

2. Pay the photographer ($100 + tip - so like $125 total) - PAY WITH CHECK
